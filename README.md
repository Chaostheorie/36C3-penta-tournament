## Installation

You will need a working python 3.5+ installation and pip. First you need to clone the repository via git or download it via your browser and unzip it.

For installing dependencies with pip use:

```bash
pip3 install -r requeriments.txt
```

Now you only need to start the local flask devolepement server with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

It can happen that at the first startup, while the db is created, the instance may happen to crash or malfunction. Just restart and restart the `main.py` file. The appplication is after this step avaliable on "<https://localhost:5000>" and you can open it with your browser.
